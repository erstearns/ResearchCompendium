_______________________

DATASET: Alpha version 2010 estimates of proportion of people per grid square living in poverty, as defined by $1.25 a day and $2 a day thresholds, and associated uncertainty metrics.
REGION: Africa

PROJECTION: Geographic, WGS84
UNITS: Proportion of residents living on $1.25 and $2 a day (poverty dataset); 95% credible interval (uncertainty dataset)
MAPPING APPROACH: Bayesian model-based geostatistics in combination with high resolution gridded spatial covariates applied to GPS-located household survey data on poverty from the DHS and/or LSMS programs.
